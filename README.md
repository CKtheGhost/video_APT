3. **AI Strategy Generation**: Based on the user's risk profile and current market conditions, the AI generates personalized investment strategies optimized for maximum yield.

4. **Strategy Execution**: Users can execute recommended strategies with a single click. The transaction manager handles all the complex operations (unstaking, swapping, providing liquidity, etc.).
